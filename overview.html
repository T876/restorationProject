            <h3>Diving Deeper:</h5>
            <p>
              I found this definition of apostasy based on the original greek <i>apostasia.</i> It helped me to understand the Great Apostasy, as well as more minor apostasies, at a deeper level:
            </p>
            <p>
              "Though the Greek term apostasia is only used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, the word apostasy has become the common expression used by members of the Latter-day Saint faith to describe the period of time in which gospel principles and priesthood authority were gradually lost in the early Church. The word literally means “to desist” or “to remove oneself,” and in contexts outside of the New Testament even “contention” or “political revolt.”[1] The writings of Paul, Peter, and John suggest that such separations were ongoing in the Church even while they struggled to teach true gospel principles to the members."
            </p>

            </a>
            <p>
              I found that this theme of contention and rebellion is a major element of the apostasy.
              While this will be an important theme to consider as we investigate further evidence that there was an actual apostasy,
              this concept can also be important in each of our own lives.
              When we let contention enter our hearts, or when our decisions are made based on pride, we open ourselves up to personal apostasy.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              The author (Daniel L. Belnap) continues:
              "In [Joseph Smith—Matthew 24:5-8], Christ provides the reader a template of events by which one can understand apostasy: deception by false Christs, offense taken by the members, betrayal by member against member, and eventually hatred towards other members. The elements of this pattern are found in the writings of Paul, Peter, and John, and when identified in their letters to the early Church, the ongoing apostasy is revealed."

            <p>
              In the rest of his article, Brother Belnap breaks down these three elements of apostasy citing examples from both the New Testament and the Book of Mormon.
              I found his thoughts very profound, and definitely recommend checking out his article. 
            </p>

              Initially, I had hoped to provide visitors to this website hard, undeniable evidence that the early church was fragmented and rebellious. 
              This proved a very daunting task that would be beyond the scope of this project. Instead, as I researched prophecies and evidences of the Great Apostasy I found some important principles.
              Both the authors of the Bible and early Christian leaders plead for unity and humility among church members. At heart, they caution us against pride.
              Pride leads us to rebel against God and to compete against one another. This is what caused the very first apostasy in the first dispensation, as well as the Great Apostasy.
              Pride has the potential to cause a personal apostasy in each of us if we do not seek to develop a strong connection with God and deep humility.

              Below is a conference talk (now a personal favorite) where Elder Neal A. Maxwell explores this in depth:

              For any who want to dive deeper, here is an article by Matthew J. Grey that I found and was able to peruse, but not explore in depth and explain here.
              This article is similar to the previous one by Brother Belnap, but explores the apostasy from the perspective of the Early Christian Fathers.
              Below are links to the article, as well as some of my personal findings from exploring the writings of Early Christian Fathers
