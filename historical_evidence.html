          <h1>Historical Evidence of The Great Apostasy</h1>
          <div class="main-container">
            <p>
              As part of my investigation, I was able to look over some of the early Christian "Apostolic" Fathers.
              This term means that these church leaders were very close to the apostles, most deriving authority from them directly.
              Among others, I found many themes of humility in their teachings. 
              Mainly, the condemning of pride and contention, which was a major focus of the Apostles as well. 
              This is what the majority of the quotes below will reference.
              I also found that many were trying to preserve the doctrine of the church, which means that schisms and corruption of doctrine were a major concern. 
              This is evidence of the first schisms among the early Christians. 
              Unfortunately, I won't be able to go very in depth about it here, but encourage you to read for yourself!

                  <h5 class="card-title">Clement - Bishop of Rome - Letter To Corinth</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Clement was the bishop of Rome from A.D. 92-101. The letter that this quote comes from was sent to the church in Corinth.
                    He outlines the state of the church there and exhorts them to stop pushing back against the elders of the Church. Here, we have evidence
                    of rebellions in the church against it's leaders soon after the death of the apostles and loss of their authority.
                  </p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 10px;" class="card-text">
                    We read "All renown and opportunity for expansion were given you - and then the scripture was fulfilled, "The beloved ate and drank, he grew broad and waxed fat and began to kick" [Deut. 32:15]. 
                    From this there arose rivalry and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and anarchy, war and captivity.
                    Thus "the ignoble" rose up "against the honorable" [Isa. 3:5], those of no reputation against those of repute, the foolish against the wise, "the young against their elders" [Isa. 3:5]. 
                    For this reason "righteousness" and peace "are far from you" [Isa 59:14], since everyone has abandoned the fear of God and lost the eyes of faith, and neither walks in the way of his commandments nor conducts himself in accordance with his duty toward Christ.
                    On the contrary, each follows the lusts of his evil heart because he has adopted that wicked and impious "jealousy" through which "death came into the world" [Wisd. 2:24; cf. Rom 5:12]."
                  </p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 10px;" >
                    Sounds like he's not messing around! He then goes on to talk about the necessity of repentance, the evils of pride, and the need for humility.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Ignatius - Second Bishop of Antioch</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Ignatius was the bishop of Antioch from about A.D. 69 to between A.D. 98 and 117. He was traditionally a disciple of the Apostle John, although we don't know for sure.
                    This letter to the Ephesians is much more loving than that of Clement, implying a different approach to leadership.
                    His words further evidence rebellion in the early church against their leaders (who may or may not have been misinterpreting things themselves).
                  </p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 10px;" class="card-text">
                    We read "For Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is expressed purpose of the father, just as the bishops who have been appointed throughout the world exist by the purpose of Jesus Christ.
                    Therefore it is fitting for you to run your race together with the bishop's purpose - as you do. For your presbytery - worthy of fame, worthy of God - is attuned to the bishop like strings to a lyre.
                    Therefore by your unity and harmonious love of Jesus Christ is sung."
                  </p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 10px;" >
                    Ignatius goes on for several more paragraphs about unity with the bishops and presbytery, and then goes on to extoll the virtues of orthodoxy.

                  <h5 class="card-title">The Letter of Barnabas</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    This letter was said to have been written by Barnabas, the Apostle Paul's companion.
                    The letter was originally anonymous, however by the year 200 A.D. Clement of Alexandria (different Clement) attributed it to Paul's companion.
                    Here, we see warnings against overconfidence and the need for unity which correspond with the teachings found in the epistles above. 
                    Keeping Christians from diverging from the truth seems to be a major focus of not just the apostles, but all early church leaders even after their deaths.
                  </p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 10px;" class="card-text">
                    We read "Wherefore let us walk circumspectly in these last days.
                    For the entire period of our life nad faith will be wasted unless now, in the lawless time and in the impending scandals, we resist as befits God's sons.
                    Therefore, lest the Black One make a deceitful entrance, let us flee from all that is irrelevant, let us hate completely the works of the wicked way.
                    Do not live monastic lives by retiring to yourselves as though you have already attained the righteous state, but by assembling together, seek out together what is to your mutual advantage"
                  </p>
                  <p style="padding-top: 10px;" >
                    This letter as well seems to be telling and warning Christians not to split and schism, but to unite.
